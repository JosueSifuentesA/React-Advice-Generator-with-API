# Random Advice Generator
This is a web-based application that displays a random advice message each time the user clicks a button. The advice messages are sourced from the https://api.adviceslip.com/advice API, which provides a wide variety of random advice messages for users to explore.

# Live demo

# Usage
To use the application, simply click the button to display a new random advice message. Each time you click the button, a new message will be fetched from the API and displayed on the screen.

# API Integration
The application uses the https://api.adviceslip.com/advice API to fetch random advice messages. The API provides a simple endpoint for fetching random advice messages, and the application makes a request to this endpoint each time the "Get Advice" button is clicked.

# Design
The application features a clean, modern design with a focus on readability and ease of use. The default theme is a dark mode.
